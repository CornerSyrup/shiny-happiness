**Solidity Blockchain Platform for Part-Time Contracts**

This repository contains a Solidity-based blockchain platform that simulates part-time contracts using Web3 technology.
The platform serves as a decentralized system, akin to a sharing economy, facilitating the trading of labour between buyers and sellers.

## Key Features

This platform aims to revolutionize part-time labour markets by providing a secure and decentralized environment for conducting transactions between buyers and sellers of labour.

- **Written in Solidity:** Utilizes Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Built on blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.
- **Web3 Compatibility:** Integrates with Web3.js, enabling interaction with the Ethereum blockchain from web applications.
- **Part-Time Contract Simulation:** Simulates part-time contracts, providing a decentralized marketplace for buyers and sellers of labour.
- **Decentralized System:** Facilitates peer-to-peer trading of labour without the need for intermediaries, fostering a sharing economy ecosystem.
